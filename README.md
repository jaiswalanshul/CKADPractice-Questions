# CKAD-Practice-Questions

This repo contains all the consolidated list of questions based on the CKAD study guide

**Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. The CNCF/Linux Foundation offers this performance-based exam which targets the developer aspect of kubernetes skills such as deploying apps, configuring apps, rolling out the application, creating persistent volumes, etc.**

**Since this exam is performance-based rather than just multiple choice questions just knowing the concepts are not enough, we need a lot of practice before the exam. This article helps you understand, practice and get you ready for the exam.**

**We are not going to discuss any concepts here, rather, I just want to create a bunch of practice questions for the CKAD exam based on the curriculum provided here.**
